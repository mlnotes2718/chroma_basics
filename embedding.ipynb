    "\n",
    "### 1. What is an Embedding?\n",
    "An **embedding** is a numerical (dense vector) representation of a discrete object (e.g., a word) that captures useful information for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: Convert symbols → numbers\n",
    "- Meaning is encoded in **geometry (distances & directions)**, not individual values\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is a Word Embedding?\n",
    "A **word embedding** maps each word to a vector such that:\n",
    "- Semantically similar words are close in vector space\n",
    "- Dissimilar words are far apart\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Word2Vec\n",
    "- GloVe\n",
    "- FastText\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Embedding Dimension: Minimum and Maximum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minimum\n",
    "- **Theoretical minimum:** 1 (not useful)\n",
    "- **Practical minimum:** ~10–50 (toy or simple tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum\n",
    "- **Theoretical maximum:** Unlimited\n",
    "- **Practical range:**\n",
    "  - Static embeddings: 100–300\n",
    "  - Transformers: 768–12,000+\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-off:\n",
    "- Too small → insufficient capacity\n",
    "- Too large → overfitting, inefficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Meaning of Each Number in an Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "Key truth:\n",
    "> **Individual embedding dimensions have no fixed human-interpretable meaning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embeddings are **distributed representations**\n",
    "- Meaning emerges from:\n",
    "  - Distances\n",
    "  - Angles\n",
    "  - Directions between vectors\n",
    "- Dimensions are **rotation-invariant** and arbitrary\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning lives in **relationships**, not coordinates.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Core principle\n",
    "**Distributional hypothesis**:\n",
    "> Words appearing in similar contexts have similar meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neural embeddings (most common)\n",
    "- Trained via **gradient descent**\n",
    "- Objective: Predict context or next word\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Word2Vec (Skip-gram, CBOW)\n",
    "  - FastText\n",
    "  - BERT, GPT\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-gradient embeddings\n",
    "- LSA (SVD-based)\n",
    "- Spectral embeddings\n",
    "- TF-IDF (not really embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Traditional NLP vs Transformer NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional NLP\n",
    "- Representations:\n",
    "  - Bag-of-Words\n",
    "  - TF-IDF\n",
    "  - N-grams\n",
    "- Position:\n",
    "  - N-grams\n",
    "  - Sliding windows\n",
    "- Interaction:\n",
    "  - Hand-crafted features\n",
    "  - RNN/LSTM recurrence\n",
    "- Pipelines were **modular and non end-to-end**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transformer NLP\n",
    "- Token embeddings\n",
    "- Positional embeddings\n",
    "- Attention mechanism\n",
    "- End-to-end learned representations\n",
    "- Contextual embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key difference:**\n",
    "> Traditional NLP separates meaning, position, and interaction; transformers learn them jointly.\n",

    "### 9. Pre-trained Embeddings: Frozen vs Fine-Tuned\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained embeddings are **initializations**, not fixed by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Frozen\n",
    "- No updates during training\n",
    "- Good for small datasets\n",
    "- Faster, more stable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Fine-tuned\n",
    "- Updated via backpropagation\n",
    "- Adapts to task/domain\n",
    "- Risk of overfitting or forgetting\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice:\n",
    "- Small data → freeze\n",
    "- Larger or domain-specific data → fine-tune (often with smaller LR)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Big Picture Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embeddings turn language into geometry\n",
    "- Individual dimensions are meaningless; geometry is everything\n",
    "- Gradient descent dominates modern embedding learning\n",
    "- In RNN/LSTM models, embeddings carry most semantic power\n",
