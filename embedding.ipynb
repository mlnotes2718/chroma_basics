    "### 1. What is an Embedding?\n",
    "An **embedding** is a numerical (dense vector) representation of a discrete object (e.g., a word) that captures useful information for machine learning models.\n",

    "- Purpose: Convert symbols → numbers\n",
    "- Meaning is encoded in **geometry (distances & directions)**, not individual values\n",

    "A **word embedding** maps each word to a vector such that:\n",
    "- Semantically similar words are close in vector space\n",
    "- Dissimilar words are far apart\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "- Word2Vec\n",

    "  - Static embeddings: 100–300\n",
